Developed a complete algorithmic crypto trading strategy entirely from scratch using Python, applying a systematic and data-driven approach to trading.

Integrated real-time and historical market data through the Binance API, enabling accurate signal generation and real-market condition analysis.

Leveraged NumPy and Pandas for efficient data processing, including cleaning, structuring, feature engineering, and calculating indicator-based trade conditions.

Implemented risk management logic, defining entry/exit conditions, stop-loss, take-profit, and position-handling rules to improve strategy robustness.

Used mplfinance to visualize candlestick charts, overlays, and trade signals, assisting in validating strategy behavior across different market conditions.

Built a comprehensive backtesting framework to evaluate the strategy’s performance, generating metrics such as win rate, profit/loss distribution, trade count, and equity curve.

Designed the project with clarity and modularity, making it scalable for future enhancements such as optimization, additional indicators, or live deployment.
